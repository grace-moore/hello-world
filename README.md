I am Grace Moore, a Tippie Business College student studying Business Analytics & Information Systems. Other than business, I am involved in the University Choir as well as am a student leader for a Christian college ministry, the Navigators. A fun fact about me is that, while I have always been a dog lover, I currently have a three-legged cat named Sukie.# hello-world
